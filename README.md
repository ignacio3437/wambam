WAM Scripts:

Have a gander...


Tips:

-Instead of typing the names and directories out you can drag them into terminal and it will type it for you. For example, instead of typing '/Users/josec/Desktop/JCScripts/FastaAnnotator/NC2.py' you can drag that Finder icon into the terminal window and it will type it for you.

-If you are already in that directory you can omit that part of the path. Example: If I'm in the folder 'FastaAnnotator' I can type 'NC2.py' instead of '/Users/josec/Desktop/JCScripts/FastaAnnotator/NC2.py'

-To rerun a command push the up arrow.

-To have Terminal autocomplete hit tab.
